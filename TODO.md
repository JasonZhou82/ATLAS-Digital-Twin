* Rick will  add to it the latest ATLAS geodb file which will be our starting point.
* Rick will upload the best paper describing organization of the geomodel.
* Jazon will make python code that will export that sqllite file into USD file(s). Check that everything is at its place in USDviewer.
* Extra goal 1 â€“ make a code that tessalates USDprimitives so they can be rendered in UE5.
* Extra goal 2 â€“ make sure all the material properties are imported correctly, volumes/masses calculated correctly. Try manipulating the ATLAS digital twin (eg. open detector and extract IBL ðŸ˜Š)
* Extra goal 3 â€“ check how one could do simple geo operations from Geant on the geometry that is in the gpu memory.
* Write a paper on whatever was accomplished, present it at GTC ðŸ˜Š.
